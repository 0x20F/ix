# Basic .ini file format
# The sections can be any name you want
# Group things in a way that feels natural to you.

# All variables within this file will be usable in 
# any file that 'ix' will read. To use them inside
# said file you use the following convention:
# #{{ section.variable }} and ix will replace it with
# the value you've defined

[globals]
# Environment variables won't be expanded here
dots = $HOME/snowwhite
# .ini rules apply
palace = ${dots}/palace


# You can have any number of sections you want
[colors]
red = #fff
blue = #00f


[paths]
# ... you get it
